# Crunchyroll-Anime-Downloader-UI
This is a very very very efficient add-on to the Crunchyroll Downloader DX program (http://goo.gl/1nGdpF). Simply place this in to the Program Folder and Run.

This program was made because I was tired of grabbing individual episodes of a show to download it; thus I created this program to automatically download the episodes I want. Here is an example:

  > Download One Piece 1 to 50 360

This piece of code downloads the first 50 episodes of One Piece in 360p. 

The equivalence being manually going to the webpage, copying the url and pasting every episode name in one at a time.

  > _start.bat http://www.crunchyroll.com/one-piece/episode-1-im-luffy-the-man-whos-gonna-be-king-of-the-pirates-650673
  > _start.bat http://www.crunchyroll.com/one-piece/episode-2-enter-the-great-swordsman-pirate-hunter-roronoa-zoro-650675
  > _start.bat http://www.crunchyroll.com/one-piece/episode-3-morgan-versus-luffy-whos-the-mysterious-pretty-girl-650677
  > [etc.]

As you can imagine this is A LOT of work. Making this method EXTREMELY MORE EFFECTIVE.
If you only want to download a couple episodes you would do this:
  > Download One Piece 1 3 5 to 7 9 11 16 to 20 480
  
This downloades episodes 1, 3, 5 - 7, 9, 11, 16 - 20 in 480p
